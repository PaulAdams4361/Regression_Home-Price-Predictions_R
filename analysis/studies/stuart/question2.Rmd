## Model

"By Hand" constuction.

Based on the correlation heatmap the following parameters have a reasonible correlation with the log of `SalePrice` without high mutual correlation.

* `GarageArea` 
* `OverallQual` 
* `GrLivArea` 
* `TotalBsmtSF` 
* `BsmtQual` 
* `YearRemodAdd` 
* `Fireplaces` 
* `YearBuilt`

Based on EDA, `TotalBsmtSF` varies by `BsmtQual`, so it will be included as an interaction. Living room areas and year built tend to vary by neighborhood, so neighborhood will be included as an interation on these variable.

This model produces an adjusted R-squared of 0.882, which is an estimate of the variability in logSalePrice that is explained by the model.

```{r, echo=F}

model.formula = log(SalePrice) ~ GarageArea + OverallQual + GrLivArea:Neighborhood + TotalBsmtSF:BsmtQual + BsmtQual + YearRemodAdd + Fireplaces + YearBuilt:Neighborhood

m <- lm(model.formula, data = train)
summary(m)
```

## Model Cross Validation

The RMSE and adjusted R-squared are estimated with 10 fold cross validation.

RMSE: 0.15
Adj R-squared: 0.86

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Set up repeated k-fold cross-validation
train.control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)
# Train the model
model.cv <- train(model.formula, 
                    data = train,
                    method = 'lm',
                    trControl = train.control)
# print model summary
model.cv
```
