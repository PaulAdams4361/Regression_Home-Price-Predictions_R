# Requested Analysis

Century 21 Ames wawnts to understand if there is a relationship between the square footage of the living areas of houses (`GrLivArea`) and sale price in the neighborhood where they operate Northwest Ames, Edwards, and Brookside (`NAmes`, `Edwards` and `BrkSide`).

# Setup

```{r, lib-read, results='hide', message=FALSE}
# libraries
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(olsrr)
library(gridExtra)
library(caret)

# set a random seed for repodicibility
set.seed(123)

# helper code
source('../helper/visual.R')
source('../helper/data_munging.R')
source('../helper/performance.R')

# load data
train <- read_csv('../data/train.csv')
test <- read_csv('../data/test.csv')
```

# Analysis

## Extract Data of Interest

```{r data-filtering, results='hide', message=FALSE}
# select data of interest
train <- train %>% 
  filter(Neighborhood == 'NAmes' | Neighborhood == 'Edwards' | Neighborhood == 'BrkSide')
train$Neighborhood <- as.factor(train$Neighborhood)
```

## Plots of Data

Barplot of count houses in `Neighborhood`s of interest.

```{r, message=FALSE}
train %>% ggplot(aes(x = Neighborhood)) + geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = 'Count of Levels of Neighborhood', 
       y = 'Count')
```

Histogram of `SalePrice`, which is the sale price of the houses in the dataset.

```{r, SalePriceHist, message=FALSE}
train %>% ggplot(aes(x = SalePrice)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = 'Histogram of Sale Price', 
       y = 'Frequency', x = 'Sale Price')
```

Histogram of `GrLivArea`, which is the square footage of the living areas of houses in the dataset.

```{r, LivingRoomHist, message=FALSE}
train %>% ggplot(aes(x = GrLivArea)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = 'Histogram of Living Room Area', 
       y = 'Frequency', x = 'Living Room Area')
```

Both variables (`SalePrice` and `GrLivArea`) show evidence of right skew. This could indicate need for a log transform.

Scatter plot of `SalePrice` vs `GrLivArea` shows that the large values in `GrLivArea` are pulling the regression line. A log transfrom on `GrLivArea` may help correct this.

```{r, regression-original-scale}
train %>% ggplot(aes(x = GrLivArea, y = SalePrice)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
  labs(title = 'Sale Price vs Living Room Area', 
       y = 'Log of Sale Price', x = 'Living Room Area')
```

Scatter plot of `SalePrice` vs log transform of `GrLivArea` shows taking the log transform of `GrLivArea` does improve the linear relationship. However, it appears that a larger value of `GrLivArea` is associated with an increase in varaince of `SalePrice`. A log transform of `SalePrice` may help control for this change in varaince.

```{r, linear-log-plot}
train %>% ggplot(aes(x = log(GrLivArea), y = SalePrice)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
  labs(title = 'Sale Price vs Log of Living Room Area', 
       y = 'Sale Price', x = 'Log of Living Room Area')
```

Scatter plot the log transform of `SalePrice` vs the log transform of `GrLivArea` shows evidece of a linear relationship without sufficient evidence of changing variance. Two points to the right side of the plot appear to be pulling the regression line to the right. These points should be investigated.

```{r, log-log-plot}
train %>% ggplot(aes(x = log(GrLivArea), y = log(SalePrice))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
  labs(title = 'Log of Sale Price vs Log of Living Room Area', 
       y = 'Log of Sale Price', x = 'Log of Living Room Area')
```

Add labels of `SaleCondition` of the two points of interest and some neighboring points to the scatter plot the log transform of `SalePrice` vs the log transform of `GrLivArea`. This indicates the influential points are of type `Partial` `SaleCondition`, which means the houses were not completed at the time of assessment.

```{r, log-log-plot-labeled}
train %>% ggplot(aes(x = log(GrLivArea), y = log(SalePrice))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
  labs(title = 'Log of Sale Price vs Log of Living Room Area', 
       y = 'Log of Sale Price', x = 'Log of Living Room Area') +
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse((log(GrLivArea) > 7.75 & log(SalePrice) > 11) |
                                 (log(SalePrice) > 12.45),
                               SaleCondition, '')), hjust=0, vjust=0)
```

Reploting without the influential values as little difference on the regression line. These points will be included in the regression analysis.

```{r, repolt-without-partial-points}
temp <- train %>% filter(SaleCondition != 'Partial')
temp %>% ggplot(aes(x = log(GrLivArea), y = log(SalePrice))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
  labs(title = 'Log of Sale Price vs Log of Living Room Area', 
       y = 'Log of Sale Price', x = 'Log of Living Room Area')
```

Scatter plot log of sale price vs log of living room area for each neighborhood. In each case, there is not sigificant evidence again the assumption of linearity.

```{r, log-log-plot-by-N}
regplot.names <- train %>% filter(Neighborhood == 'NAmes') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(GrLivArea), y = log(SalePrice))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
  labs(subtitle = 'Northwest Ames', 
       y = 'Log of Sale Price', x = 'Log of Living Room Area')
regplot.ed <- train %>% filter(Neighborhood == 'Edwards') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(GrLivArea), y = log(SalePrice))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
  labs(subtitle = 'Edwards', 
       y = 'Log of Sale Price', x = 'Log of Living Room Area')
regplot.brk <- train %>% filter(Neighborhood == 'BrkSide') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(GrLivArea), y = log(SalePrice))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
  labs(subtitle = 'Brook Side', 
       y = 'Log of Sale Price', x = 'Log of Living Room Area')
grid.arrange(regplot.names,regplot.ed,regplot.brk, nrow = 2,
             top = 'Regression Plots for Neighborhoods')
```

## Model

Based on the log-log plot above, the response will be modeled as

![model_equation](./question1_files/model_equation.png)

where Edwards neighborhood is used for reference.

### Parameter Estimation

Estimate parameters in the model by fitting to the entire dataset.

```{r, modeling, message=FALSE}
model.formula = log(SalePrice) ~ log(GrLivArea) + 
     Neighborhood_BrkSide + 
     Neighborhood_NAmes +
     log(GrLivArea) * Neighborhood_BrkSide + 
     log(GrLivArea) * Neighborhood_NAmes

# create dummy variables with Neighborhood == 'Edwards' as reference
train <- get.dummies(train, "Neighborhood", 'Edwards')

# model the mean response given equation above
model <- lm(formula = model.formula, data = train)
summary(model)
```

### Model Accuracy Estimation

Use 10-fold cross validation to estimate the accuracy metrics of the model.

```{r, cross-validation}
# Set up repeated k-fold cross-validation
train.control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)
# Train the model
model.cv <- train(model.formula, 
                    data = train,
                    method = 'lm',
                    trControl = train.control)
# print model summary
model.cv

# get the CV results
res <- model.cv$results

# get cross-validated PRESS statistic
PCV <- PRESS.cv(model.cv)

# print accuracy metrics to md table
kable(data.frame('RMSE'=res$RMSE,
           'CV Press'=PCV,
           'Adjused_R_Squared'=res$Rsquared))
```
